# Supplication App
The Supplication App is an all purpose ticketing system that allows customers to send tickets that admins can then resolve. In its current iteration, it is a tongue in cheek prayer app modeled after many customer support interfaces. It can be easily repurposed for any business or enterprise.
## Installation
```bash
gem install supplication
```
## Usage
Users can log in and create accounts which keeps track of all their tickets. Admins have the ability to view and edit all tickets.
